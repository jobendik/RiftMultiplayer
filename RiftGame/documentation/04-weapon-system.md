# 04 - WEAPON SYSTEM

**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Foundation System  
**Status**: 🟢 Complete  
**Dependencies**: 01-Player Controller, 02-Camera System, 06-Hit Detection  
**Estimated Complexity**: Very High  
**Time Estimate**: 12-20 hours

## 📋 Overview

The weapon system is the **core interaction** of Rift. This system handles all shooting mechanics, weapon behavior, ammo management, reload, weapon switching, and weapon feel. It must feel snappy, powerful, and satisfying.

### Why This Matters
- **Primary interaction**: 90% of gameplay is shooting
- **Game identity**: Weapons define the game's personality
- **Player agency**: Weapons are the player's primary tool
- **Viral potential**: Great gunfeel generates clips and buzz
- **Skill expression**: Weapon mastery is the core skill

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Shots don't register
**Solution**: Ensure raycast origin is camera position, direction is forward

### Issue: Fire rate inconsistent
**Solution**: Use fixed timestamp comparison, not frame delta time

### Issue: Reload doesn't work
**Solution**: Check reload timer, ensure not firing during reload

### Issue: Weapon switching broken
**Solution**: Properly deactivate old weapon before activating new

### Issue: Ammo goes negative
**Solution**: Clamp ammo to 0, prevent firing at 0

### Issue: Recoil feels wrong
**Solution**: Tune recoil recovery speed, add slight randomization

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

### Optimization Targets
- Weapon update: < 1ms per frame
- Fire logic: < 0.5ms per shot

- No GC from weapon logic

### Optimization Strategies
- [ ] Cache transform references
- [ ] Reuse Vec3 objects for raycasting
- [ ] Pool muzzle flash particles
- [ ] Limit active effects per weapon
- [ ] Use object pooling for bullet tracers
