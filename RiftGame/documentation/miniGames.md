🟪 SECTION 1 — Minigame Philosophy for RIFT
Core Belief

Minigames in RIFT are not distractions or filler content.
They are micro-experiences distilled from the core philosophy of RIFT:

extreme speed

precise responsiveness

explosive feedback

neon energy

instant fun

“one more run” replayability

Every minigame must feel like RIFT, not a separate game.

Purpose

RIFT minigames serve three primary goals:

1. Retention

Give players a reason to return every day → daily, weekly, seasonal challenges.

2. Virality

Short, intense, visually striking runs that are perfect for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and clips.

3. Skill Mastery

Each minigame focuses on a specific subset of RIFT’s skill ceiling:

mobility

reaction speed

precision

decision-making

aim control

flow

Design Rules

Every RIFT minigame must:

use the same neon visual identity

keep UI minimal, readable, reactive

reuse RIFT’s sound framework (punchy, hyper-processed, stylized)

maintain tight input responsivity

use the same feedback system (hitmarkers, score pulses, combo popups)

be learnable in 5 seconds, masterable in months

Minigames should be short, intense, replayable, and skill-based.
