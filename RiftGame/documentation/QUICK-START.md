## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### 1. GPT-Readable Structure
Every document is written so a GPT can:
- **Parse** the current state
- **Locate** relevant code
- **Verify** implementation
- **Check** completion criteria
- **Update** documentation
- **Resume** after context wipe

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage
Every critical feature is documented:
- Player movement & feel
- Camera systems
- Weapon mechanics
- Combat feedback
- Visual effects
- AI systems
- Game modes
- Progression
- Audio design
- UI/HUD
- And 114+ more systems

### 3. Verification Built-In
Each system includes:
- Automated checks (code presence, variables, functions)
- Manual testing checklists
- Performance criteria
- Definition of done

### 4. Context-Resilient
When context window fills:
1. Update current system document
2. Update master index
3. Wipe context
4. Reload master index + current system
5. Continue exactly where you left off

## 🤖 How to Use This (With GPT)

### Starting a Session

**Prompt Example:**
```
I'm working on Rift, a minimalistic FPS game. I have a complete 
blueprint in /rift-blueprint/. 

Load:
1. 00-MASTER-INDEX.md
2. README.md  
3. 01-core-systems/01-player-controller.md

Then help me implement the player controller system, checking off 
items as we complete them.
```

### Verification Sessions

**Prompt Example:**
```
Load /rift-blueprint/01-core-systems/01-player-controller.md

Then search my PlayCanvas codebase and verify which checklist items 
are complete. Update the checkboxes based on what you find. Tell me 
what's done and what's still needed.
```

### Context Recovery

**Prompt Example:**
```
I'm continuing work on Rift. Load:
1. /rift-blueprint/00-MASTER-INDEX.md
2. /rift-blueprint/01-core-systems/[current-system].md

Review the current progress and tell me what task I should work on next.
```

## 📋 Each System Document Contains

### Structure
1. **Overview** - What and why
2. **Design Goals** - Feel targets, references
3. **Dependencies** - What's needed first
4. **Core Components** - Architecture breakdown
5. **Implementation Checklist** - Detailed tasks with ☐ boxes
6. **Verification Criteria** - How to check it's done
7. **Code Location Hints** - Where to put code
8. **Common Issues** - Known problems & solutions
9. **Performance Targets** - Optimization goals
10. **Integration Points** - How it connects to other systems
11. **References** - Docs, examples, resources
12. **Success Metrics** - How to know it's good
13. **Definition of Done** - Final completion criteria

### Example Task Breakdown
Instead of vague "implement movement", you get:

```
Phase 1: Basic Movement
  ☐ Create player entity
  ☐ Add capsule collider
  ☐ Implement ground check
  ☐ Capture WASD input
  ☐ Apply acceleration
  ☐ Apply deceleration
  ☐ Test: Movement feels snappy
  
Phase 2: Jump System
  ☐ Capture jump input
  ☐ Apply upward force
  ☐ Implement coyote time
  ☐ Implement jump buffer
  ☐ Test: Jumping feels fair
  
... and so on
```

## 💡 How This Solves Your Problems

### Problem 1: "I lose track when context resets"
**Solution**: Master index + system docs = instant state recovery

### Problem 2: "Hard for GPT to find what's implemented"
**Solution**: Verification criteria are GPT-readable checks

### Problem 3: "Don't know what to build next"
**Solution**: Priority-ordered, dependency-mapped systems

### Problem 4: "Forget important features"
**Solution**: 124 systems documented = nothing missed

### Problem 5: "Quality inconsistent"
**Solution**: Every system has success metrics and done criteria

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
