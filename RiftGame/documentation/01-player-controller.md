# 01 - PLAYER CONTROLLER

**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Foundation System  
**Status**: 🟡 In Progress  
**Dependencies**: None (foundational)  
**Estimated Complexity**: High  
**Time Estimate**: 8-12 hours

---

## 📋 Overview

The player controller is the **absolute foundation** of Rift's gameplay. This system handles all player movement, physics, and input response. It must feel snappy, responsive, and precise - like an extension of the player's body.

### Why This Matters
- **First impression**: Movement is the first thing players experience
- **Core loop**: Players spend 100% of gameplay time moving
- **Feel foundation**: All other systems build on this feel
- **Differentiation**: Exceptional movement separates good FPS from great FPS

## 🎯 Design Goals

### Feel Targets
- [x] **Snappy**: Zero input lag, instant response
- [x] **Precise**: Predictable, controllable, fair
- [x] **Fluid**: Smooth transitions, maintained momentum
- [x] **Skill-based**: High skill ceiling, mastery rewarding
- [x] **Fast**: High base speed, sprint multiplier

### Reference Games
- DOOM Eternal (snap + aggression)
- Titanfall 2 (fluid + momentum)
- Quake Champions (precise + air control)
- Krunker (instant + responsive)

PlayerController.attributes.add('sprintSpeed', { type: 'number', default: 12.0 });
// ... more attributes

PlayerController.prototype.initialize = function() {
    // Setup
    this.velocity = new pc.Vec3();
    this.isGrounded = false;
    this.isSprinting = false;
};

PlayerController.prototype.update = function(dt) {
    this.checkGround();
    this.handleInput();
    this.updateVelocity(dt);
    this.applyMovement(dt);
};

PlayerController.prototype.checkGround = function() {
    // Ground detection logic
};

PlayerController.prototype.handleInput = function() {
    // Input capture and processing
};

PlayerController.prototype.updateVelocity = function(dt) {
    // Acceleration, friction, gravity
};

PlayerController.prototype.applyMovement = function(dt) {
    // Apply final velocity to player
};
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Player slides after releasing keys
**Solution**: Increase ground deceleration value, add stronger friction

### Issue: Movement feels floaty
**Solution**: Increase gravity, reduce air time, add fall multiplier

### Issue: Can't climb small ledges
**Solution**: Implement step-up system with max step height

### Issue: Player gets stuck on geometry
**Solution**: Add collision margin, smooth collision response, increase capsule radius

### Issue: Diagonal movement too fast
**Solution**: Normalize input vector before applying

### Issue: Input feels delayed
**Solution**: Use FixedUpdate or ensure input capture is in update loop

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

### Optimization Targets
- Movement update: < 1ms per frame
- Ground check: < 0.1ms per frame

### Optimization Strategies
- [ ] Cache transform references
- [ ] Reuse Vec3 objects (don't create new each frame)
