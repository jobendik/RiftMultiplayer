# 🎮 RIFT - GAME DEVELOPMENT BLUEPRINT

**Welcome to the complete, step-by-step development guide for Rift**

This blueprint is a comprehensive, methodical, and GPT-optimized system for building Rift from foundation to completion. Every feature, every system, and every detail is documented with implementation checklists, verification criteria, and integration points.

---

## 📖 What Is This?

This is a **production blueprint** - a complete roadmap that:

- ✅ **Lists every feature** needed for Rift
- ✅ **Breaks down complexity** into manageable tasks
- ✅ **Provides verification criteria** so a GPT can check completion
- ✅ **Organizes by priority** so you always know what to build next
- ✅ **Includes code hints** so implementation is clear
- ✅ **Tracks progress** with checkboxes and status indicators
- ✅ **Maintains context** so work can resume after context wipe
- ✅ **Documents integration** so systems connect properly

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Methodical Progress**: Build systems in dependency order
2. **Verifiable Completion**: Every task has clear done criteria
3. **GPT-Readable**: Structured for AI assistant comprehension
4. **Context-Resilient**: Can recover from context window resets
5. **Quality-First**: No shortcuts, no "good enough"

### Why This Structure?

Traditional game design docs are **narrative** - they describe *what* but not *how*.  
This blueprint is **executable** - it tells you *exactly* what to do, in order, with verification.

## 💡 Best Practices

### Implementation

- ✅ **Start small** - Get basics working first
- ✅ **Test constantly** - Verify as you build
- ✅ **Iterate feel** - Polish until it feels right
- ✅ **Document changes** - Update docs with discoveries
- ✅ **Maintain quality** - Don't accept "good enough"

### Code Organization

- ✅ **Follow structure** - Use suggested file layouts
- ✅ **Name clearly** - Use descriptive names
- ✅ **Comment intent** - Explain why, not what
- ✅ **Keep clean** - Refactor as you go
- ✅ **Profile early** - Watch performance from start

### Collaboration

- ✅ **Update docs** - Keep blueprint current
- ✅ **Note blockers** - Document issues immediately
- ✅ **Share progress** - Update status regularly
- ✅ **Request reviews** - Get feedback on systems
- ✅ **Learn together** - Share discoveries

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Don't Skip Dependencies
Systems build on each other. Missing foundations cause rework.

### ❌ Don't Skip Verification
Untested systems break later. Verify everything.

### ❌ Don't Over-Optimize Early
Make it work, then make it fast. Premature optimization wastes time.

### ❌ Don't Ignore Feel
Numbers don't matter if it doesn't feel good. Polish feel constantly.

### ❌ Don't Work in Isolation
Test integration frequently. Systems must work together.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't know where to start"
→ Open `00-MASTER-INDEX.md`, start at system 01

### "System seems incomplete"
→ Check dependencies, verify prerequisites are done

### "Can't verify completion"
→ Follow verification criteria exactly, update checklist

### "Context window full"
→ Update docs, save progress, wipe context, reload index

### "System is blocked"
→ Note blocker, move to next unblocked system

### "Lost track of progress"
→ Review master index, scan completed checkboxes
